// Continuations represent at computation which can be continued at a later time
// They are a way of avoiding enormous convoluted stack frames that emerge from
// composing a chain of functions in an RLS.  They continue the current computation
// in a stack frame much closer to the users invocation
// ideally Any? would be replaced with Continuation? but swift does not allow
// recursive type definitions
