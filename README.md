# ReallyLazySequences
Asynchronous Sequences for Swift

### Rules

1. Everything is a Sequence and sequence is preserved, i.e. in a multi-threaded environment, the consumer of a ReallyLazySequence should see things in the same order they would appear in the single-threaded environment.
1. All data structures are structs, not classes
1. Everything is asynchronous-capable
1. Every swift.Sequence function is implemented _as is_, only with a possibly different return value
1. All structs have no methods other than init. Sequence functions _all_ occur in protocol extensions.
1. We should never see a 100 level deep stack trace (implies use of Continuations)
1. Single-thread and thread-safe versions are supported. Single-thread is for performance reasons. (Also implies use of Continuations)
in the single-threaded environment
1. The order of evaluation for each sequence can be read from the nested type information
1. Error handling is in line rather than passed up or down the chain

### Notes

1. All Sequences have a InputType and a OutputType.  Values of type InputType enter at the head of the sequence and values of type OutputType come out at the end.
1. Putting a value in does not necessarily cause a value to come out.  
1. Sending the nil value in will cause all in-progress values to emerge at the end and reset internal state
1. You cannot put values into a Sequence object, you must first create a Consumer of the sequence by calling consume() on a Sequence and passing a closure which will consume the output values.  Values of InputType may be pushed into the resulting Consumer.
1. You may create a Producer from a Sequence by specifying a closure which produces values of type InputType.  
1. Producers must be consumed before they can be started.  Consuming a Producer returns a Task which may be started and which will call a ccompletion handler when the TaskCompletes
1. Composition of a sequence consists of creating a single closure from the closures and values associated with each predecessor of the given sequence


### Questions
1. Is it worth preserving sequence at the expense of performance?
1. Is composability too hard a concept? Are Producer, Consumer, Task and Sequence the right abstractions?
1. Should error handling be in-line, at front or at end?
1. Are enormous stack frames really a problem if you can read where they come from?
1. Is it worth it to preserve the type names in long form? e.g. `Consumer<Reduce<Map<Sort<Map<Map<Filter<ReallyLazySequence<Int>, Int>, Double>, Double>, Double>, Int>, Int>>`
1. How can I get rid of boilerplate in the RLS extensions?
1. Should sending nil into a consumer represent completion or just clear/reset?
